<p>Welcome to my page,
<p>I will introduce myself as an enthusiastic person, who was born and raised in Honduras until the age of eighteen-years old. I came to United State with the purpose to study advertising and seek further opportunities.
Furthermore, my plan after my graduation is to specialize myself as a creative advertiser with marketing knowledge in social media and digital media campaigns. In addition of what has been said, I would love to get experience in the development of strategic plans for branding and rebranding campaigns, which is one of the things I enjoy the most in advertising.
Finally, I would describe myself as a challenging person, who likes to challenge others to pursuit their dreams. I always like to keep myself in constant renewing, since this world is changing digitally and I like to move on with it. I am the person behind the Big Idea and I do not concern too much on who gets credit, I only care about seeing positive results from it. 
<p>Thank you for checking out my profile!</h2>
